# Data Structures

## Introduction

Welcome to my data structure practice repository! Here, you'll find comprehensive documentation of my journey as I delve into the world of data structures. This repository is a treasure trove of my notes, thoughts, and even some repetitive practices that I've embraced wholeheartedly. I aim to enhance my understanding of algorithms and sharpen my problem-solving skills. Join me on this exciting adventure of continuous learning and brain training!

## Data Structures:

1. Binary Search Tree
2. Tree Traversal
3. LinkedList
4. Doubly LinkedList
5. Graph
6. HashTable
7. Recursion
8. Sort
9. Stacks and Queues
10. Leetcode practices

## Notes:

1. Leetocode practices (ones that I redid multiple times):
   1. kth_smallest_node (TreeTraversal): this one was a pain and had to draw out the nodes on paper to understand which nodes the `stack` and `current_node` were at
   2. reverse_between (LinkedList): needed 3 pointers to keep tabs of `prev` node, `current` node, and the `after` node
2. Insertion sort: was a bit tricky because there were a lot of pointers flying around
